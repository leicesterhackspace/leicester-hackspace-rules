The Hackspace has limited space available, so we need some rules for members leaving possessions and projects at the
space.

If you must leave a project at the Hackspace, you don't own a project box, or your project is too large for your project
box, then you can label it "Do Not Hack" alongside your full name and the date. You must tuck the project out of the way
so it does not prevent any other members from using any of the equipment.  
If you fail to label your project, then it may be mistaken for being hackable.

**Optional rule to be discussed at the general meeting April 2025:**  
You may not store projects outside a project box for more than 6 months without fortnightly work. We do not have the
space available. Labelled projects will be checked regularly, and you will be asked to remove any expired projects  
**End optional rule to be discussed at the general meeting April 2025**

If you need to store equipment or projects at the hackspace more permanently, then you can ask the directors for a
Project Box. To be entitled to a project box, you must pay at least Â£10 in membership dues.

Possessions left in project boxes are stored at the owner's risk. Members who access project boxes that do not belong to
them will receive a warning.
