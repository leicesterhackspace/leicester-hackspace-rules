The Hackspace has limited space available, so we need some rules for members leaving possessions and projects at the
space.

If you must leave a project at the Hackspace, you don't own a project box, or your project is too large for your project
box, then you can label it "Do Not Hack" alongside your full name and the date. You must tuck the project out of the way
so it does not prevent any other members from using any of the equipment.  
If you fail to label your project, then it may be mistaken for being hackable.  
Projects stored at the space that excessively block regular hackspace activities, either by being stored inconveniently
or by taking up an unreasonable amount of space, will be requested for removal at the director's discretion.

You may not store projects outside a project box for more than 3 months without at least fortnightly work. We do not
have the space available. Labelled projects will be checked regularly, and you will be asked to remove any expired
projects. This does not apply to infrastructure projects (I.E, projects that are commissioned by the directors for the
benefit of the hackspace).  
Any projects that remain at the space after having been requested for removal for more than 2 weeks will be disposed
of.

If you need to store equipment or projects at the hackspace more permanently, then you can ask the directors for a
Project Box. To be entitled to a project box, you must pay at least Â£10 in membership dues.

Possessions left in project boxes are stored at the owner's risk. Members who access project boxes that do not belong to
them will receive a warning.
