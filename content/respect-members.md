We do not tolerate any sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, or anything else we mention in our
anti-discrimination policy. We are a friendly, welcoming community, and we will not allow anyone to make any other
members feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.

Please do not think that because it was "just a joke", or, "people are being too sensitive" that this is acceptable.
From a practical point of view there are [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law) we need to
follow. You might like to look at some
[government advice on the subject](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination).

If you have a problem with another member that you cannot resolve, you can follow our
[complaints process]({{< ref "complaints-warnings.md#complaints" >}}) to let us know and get it dealt with.

If you feel like you are being treated unfairly by a director, then we have
[a process for that too here]({{< ref "complaints-warnings.md#complaints-raised-by-or-against-a-director">}}). The
directors should be dedicated to making sure the Hackspace is safe and friendly for everyone, so if a director is being
a problem then the other directors should be made aware so they can remove them.
