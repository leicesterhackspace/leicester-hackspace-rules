Welcome to the Leicester Hackspace Rules. This page contains the rules that we expect every member and guest to adhere
to.

## [0: Do not be on fire]({{< ref "do-not-be-on-fire.md" >}}) {.header}
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using the Hackspace in a manner that is safe for you and safe for
everyone else.

Members are expected to pay their dues and to hold themselves to a certain conduct.

## [2: Guests]({{< ref "guests.md" >}}) {.header}
You may bring guests, but they must follow guidelines, and you are responsible for them and their actions.

## [3: Respect Other Members]({{< ref "respect-members.md" >}}) {.header}
The Hackspace is a community, you are to respect one and other and follow our code of conduct.

## [4: Respect The Space]({{< ref "respect-space.md" >}}) {.header}
The Hackspace as an area is run by its members. You are responsible for keeping the space tidy.

## [5: Respect The equipment]({{< ref "respect-equipment.md" >}}) {.header}
The equipment is freely provided to members. In order for this to be maintainable, members must treat the equipment with
respect

## [6: Storage]({{< ref "storage.md" >}}) {.header}
We have limited space in the Hackspace, so there are guidelines to what of your own projects you can store at the
space.

We still have limited space, we cannot accept every donation to the space.
