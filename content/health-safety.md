**Health & Safety is the responsibility of every member of Leicester Hackspace.** It is the duty of each member to make
sure they are safe and not endangering the people around them.

When in doubt about another member's safety do approach them to discuss it, or raise it with the directors. Every
Hackspace member has the right and responsibility to challenge unsafe behaviours.

## Equipment
The Hackspace has a lot of potentially dangerous tools available to members; if you are not confident with a tool or
machine, or haven't used it before, you should ask to be inducted on it. For machines without specific inductions,
another member will typically be willing to provide advice; the best places to ask for help is on the Discord, or in
person at the space on a Tuesday or a Thursday.

The following quote provides good guidance on workshop safety:
> Before we use any power tools, let's take a moment to talk about shop safety. Be sure to read, understand, and follow
all the safety rules that come with your power tools. Knowing how to use your power tools properly will greatly reduce
the risk of personal injury. And remember this: there is no more important safety rule than to wear these â€” safety
glasses.

## PPE
An effort is made to ensure Safety equipment (PPE) is readily available within the wood working area; a range of PPE
such as goggles, gloves, face masks, disposable ear plugs, and other such items are available for use by all members and
topped up on a semiregular basis. Please ensure PPE is used. If it appears to be running low, you can help by informing
the directors at [info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk).

## Ladders
> Did you know, falling from a ladder is the leading cause of injury and death in worksites?

Members are not permitted to use ladders at the hackspace without permission from the directors. Anything stored high up
is for hackspace infrastructure, and should not be accessed by the members without reason or express permission.

For high shelves, you may use the stepladder that is kept by the front door.

## Allergies
We have some members with severe allergies to nuts. As of such we do not allow any nuts, or nut based products,
at the hackspace premises.  
If you have a similar severe allergy, please let us know at
[info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk) and we will be happy to accommodate you.

## First Aid
A First Aid Box is kept stocked and checked periodically. Please ensure you are familiar with where this is stored -
it can be found in the **Kitchen**, on the left side near the kettles.

If you use anything from the kit, please report the injury using the accident reporting form explained below.

## Accident and Near Miss Reporting
It is important that accidents, whether resulting in an injury or near miss, are logged. This helps us improve the
safety of the hackspace. It guides our induction processes and prompts us to check the first aid kits more regularly
than scheduled.

Posters for our Near Miss and Accident reporting form can be found around the space. The posters contain a QR code which
you can scan from your phone.

You can access the form here: https://forms.gle/5o7ijTGJBsLeb9Mg6

When an accident is reported, the directors are notified immediately. This ensures we are able to make necessary
improvements as quickly as possible.

## Fires
If there is a fire in the hackspace, leave using the nearest clear exit, either the front door, or the fire exit in the
3d printing room. If there are no clear exits, use the fire extinguishers to assist with your escape.

Fire extinguishers can be found in the following places:
- A Foam and a CO~2~ next to the front door
- A CO~2~ next to the laser cutter
- A Foam and a CO~2~ in the 3d printing room (TODO: Precise location TBD)
- A Foam and a CO~2~ in the wood working room (TODO: Precise location TBD)

Once you are safely outside the building, call the emergency services using 999. Your safety is the priority in the
event of a fire, forget any equipment, valuables, or otherwise.
