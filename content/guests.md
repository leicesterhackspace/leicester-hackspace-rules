We welcome guests to the Hackspace. Guests must be accompanied by a current member who will be wholly responsible for
the guest, their safety, and their actions at the Hackspace.

"Guests" include a member's: children, friends, social workers, disability support, assistants, and pets. Please do not
leave any of these unattended in the Hackspace. They are your responsibility and must be attended at all times.

Guests are not expected to pay anything for access to the space, unless they wish to attend the hackspace in their own
time, or make semi-frequent use of the equipment at the space.

Guests will not be allowed to use any equipment that requires an induction. Including, but not limited to, the 3d
printers, wood working equipment, and the laser cutter.

If a non-member wishes to visit but does not have a current member to accompany them, then you can visit on one of our
open hack nights on Tuesday evenings. You can find information about visiting on
[our website](https://leicesterhackspace.org.uk).

Members should not otherwise let non-members they do not know into the space. Feel free to challenge people to authenticate
with the front door if you don't believe they are a member. You are under no obligation to answer the door if the
doorbell rings.
