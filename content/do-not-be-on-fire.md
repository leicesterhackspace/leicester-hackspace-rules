When using the Hackspace, each member is responsible for their own safety, as well as the safety of those around them. A
member is expected to follow the [Health and Safety rules]({{< ref "health-safety.md" >}}) at all times whilst at The
Hackspace.  
When using equipment, members are expected to know what they are doing and are expected to use the equipment safely. If
you want to use a tool or piece of equipment that you are unfamiliar with, feel free to ask other members for help, as
there will likely be someone willing to assist.

Members are also responsible for their own Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) as required for using any equipment
provided by the Hackspace. We will make an effort to provide PPE required for the equipment we have, however, as PPE can
be misplaced by other members we do not guarantee that it will always be available. If you notice we are missing some
required PPE, please let us know at [info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:info@leicesterhackspace.org.uk).

Whilst you shouldn't normally try to physically intervene, members should make an effort to assist when they notice
other members using equipment unsafely.

Members should make an effort to use the right tool for the right job. Misusing tools will cause damage, and we are not
able to constantly replace equipment.
