We welcome anyone over the age of 18 to join the Hackspace. You can find out how to become a new member
[here](https://leicesterhackspace.org.uk).

Members are required to maintain paying monthly dues of at least Â£10 to the Hackspace in order to maintain their
membership. If you do not feel like you can afford this, or do not feel that you use the Hackspace enough to justify
this cost, then please speak with any of our directors and we will work something out that you can manage.
If a member makes a large amount of use of the space and it's equipment, then we would expect them to make a larger
monthly payment to help support the increased maintenance.  
We reserve the right to increase expected monthly dues should it be required.

When a member ceases their monthly dues payment, then they will be regarded as a Former Member. A notification will be
sent to the members email, and they will be expected to remove any of their possessions from the space. Any labelled
possessions left at the Hackspace after 2 months will be disposed of abiding by
[The Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/32). If you become a former
member and have any equipment that you have loaned to the Hackspace (see 7 - Donations and Loans), then if you wish you
may continue to loan the equipment, but you should discuss this with a director.

Leicester Hackspace is required under [The Companies Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents) to keep
a record of the name, and current address of each member. It is very important that you keep this up-to-date, including
your full legal name and email address for contact purposes. The full extent of this is expanded on in
[GDPR and Privacy]({{< ref "privacy.md" >}}).

Your membership may be revoked at the discretion of The Directors if you break the rules. The process of this is
expanded on in [Complaints and Warnings]({{< ref "complaints-warnings.md#warnings" >}}).
