Members are encouraged to use the tools and equipment provided at the space. They are, after all, here to be used.
Members must treat all equipment at the Hackspace with respect. If you misuse and break any equipment then we quite
often can't replace it. Some equipment is also on loan from members (See
[7 - Donations and loans]({{< ref "donations.md" >}}) ), we expect you to take extra care with these.

Sometimes, even when you're being careful, tools and equipment can break. You will not be in trouble if equipment you
are using is damaged, all tools wear and mistakes will always happen. We do however require that members report any
broken equipment, whether you have broken it or not. You may receive a warning if you are caught covering up damaged
equipment.  
You can report broken equipment anonymously here: https://forms.gle/mPVbNaJvStkUhKR59, or by emailing
[broken@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:broken@leicesterhackspace.org.uk).

Some equipment can in particular a safety risk, or complex to use correctly. For this equipment we do not allow members
to use them without first going through an induction. You can find which equipment require an induction, as well as who
is responsible for them, [here](TODO: Wiki Page).

Some equipment may be labelled indicating whether you should use it or not, some of these labels include:

**Do Not Hack**
This is the most common and important label, it indicates that you should not use, take apart, or scavenge the item for
parts.  
You will usually find this on other peoples project or Hackspace infrastructure.

**Please Hack Me**
This indicates that the item is specifically for use, and you're free to integrate it into a project, or harvest it for
parts.  
You will usually find this on junk or kits that have been around for a while.

**Do Not Hack But Please Use Me**
This indicates that you should not take the item apart, but you are free to use it for its intended purpose.
You will usually find this on tools.

For all unlabelled equipment, you can assume it is hackable (Maybe double check if it looks like someone's project
though).

Equipment and tools at the Hackspace should stay at the Hackspace unless you get explicit permission from a director or
the member managing that equipment.

### Computer-aided manufacturing
This category of equipment includes:
- 3d Printers
- CNC Machines
- The Laser Cutter

These machines have some additional restrictions.

They are not free to use as they can be expensive to run and require consumables and constant maintenance. You can find
their pricing [here](TODO: Wiki Link).

Members are responsible for the equipment whilst it is running their code. This means you cannot leave the machine
unattended until it is finished. You must be present at the Hackspace whilst the machine is running your code. If you
abandon the machine before it is finished then you may get a warning.

Any damage to these machines due to the code you run will be forgiven and repaired as long as you let us know about it
([broken@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:broken@leicesterhackspace.org.uk)).
