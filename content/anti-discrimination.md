At The Leicester Hackspace, we do not as an organisation tolerate
[discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination).

Leicester Hackspace intends to provide everyone a harassment-free environment, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion

Harassment includes (but isnâ€™t limited to) offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
age, physical appearance, body size, mental health, race, religion; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following;
inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; and inappropriate or non-consensual photography or
recording; sustained disruption of events; or any action that makes another member uncomfortable.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behaviour, by anyone, is expected to do so immediately.

**THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY, INCLUDE EVERYONE, COLLABORATE**.

This means no:
- sexism
- racism
- ageism
- comments about any particular current religion or religious group
- discrimination against those with physical or mental disabilities
- homophobia, transphobia
- and anything else which reasonably comes under 'discrimination'

Please do not think that because it was "just a joke", or, "people are being too sensitive" that this is acceptable.
From a practical point of view there are [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law) we need to
follow. You might like to look at some
[government](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination) advice on the subject.

Please actively include everyone in projects, events and knowledge-sharing regardless of their skills, background or
individual differences.

If you believe you or anyone else are being harassed, then please do not allow it to happen. If you can, challenge the
behaviour, if you are unable to, or you find it continues regardless, then please report the person and their behaviour
to The Directors directly or by following our [Complaints Process]({{< ref "complaints-warnings.md#complaints" >}}).
