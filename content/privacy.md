## Section Five - Further Information on the Use of Your Data

### Membership Data
When you join the hackspace, we will collect, process and store certain personal information for the following purposes:
1) As a Company Limited by Guarantee, we are required to maintain accurate records of the **names** and **addresses** of
   all members for at least 6 years after they are no longer a member. The latter of these will also be checked upon
   joining the Hackspace, to confirm that it is a valid address.
2) We will primarily contact members via email for company-related information, such as updates on events and other
   important news. We may also contact members if there is a problem that requires their attention. For this purpose, in
   the event that you cannot be reached via email, we will communicate via post to the address associated with your
   Membership. If you have provided us with your phone number, this may also be used to contact you, in case of a
   time-sensitive matter or emergency. You may be contacted by a director or a member of the membership team.

Further to the above, we may contact you if we are advised of a misuse of the Hackspace and its tools, or if a complaint
was made against and/or concerns you. We also store any information necessary for maintaining the safety of the
Hackspace, such as details on any rule infractions and complaints made against members.

### Membership Data Deletion
We will retain sufficient information in order to identify any individuals who are banned from the Hackspace. This data
will be held for the length of said individual’s ban, plus the 6 years defined within our legal obligations.

Any information pertaining to complaints and rule infractions will be maintained for as long as the individual remains a
member of the Hackspace, plus the 6 years defined in our legal obligations.

All personal information will be held indefinitely for as long as a member wishes to have an account. Removal of this
information may be requested by contacting the directors, with the exception of an individual’s name and address, which
we are legally obliged to retain for 6 years.

### Access to the Hackspace
When you access the Hackspace, we collect, process and store information in order to identify who has entered the Space,
who is using what equipment, and when.

We log timed RFID door openings to the Hackspace indefinitely, for security and troubleshooting reasons (i.e. to prevent
unauthorized access and to resolve any technical issues that may arise with the entry system).

The identifying details of banned members (i.e. the information obtained from their RFID key fob) will be retained for
the duration of an individual’s ban, plus the 6 years defined within our legal obligations. These may be provided to
directors and/or members of the management team at any time, in order to assist in identifying those who should no
longer be using the Hackspace.

The Hackspace Doors keep a log of the time(s) they are accessed, and the unique identifying code of the key fobs used to
access them. These logs may be used to identify members who were in the Hackspace at the time of an incident or
complaint, for investigative purposes.

If an individual informs us of any accessibility requirements, these will be retained for as long as the individual is a
member of the Hackspace, plus 6 years, as per our legal obligations. This is to allow us to accommodate your
requirements, wherever possible.

### Use of the Hackspace’s Tools
A number of the Hackspace’s tools are controlled and monitored via the use of RFID technology, in order to identify who
is using the tools, when, and for how long.

We collect, store, and display information about tool bookings. If you book tools online, your booking information will
be visible to others via the Online Booking Calendar.

We log user access to our tools, in order to ensure that they are maintained, and that all users are inducted and ‘safe’
to use them. This information is also used for billing purposes and to guide future tool purchasing decisions. This may
also be used for investigative purposes, in the event of a rules break or complaint. This information is retained
indefinitely but may be decoupled from an individual, upon request, after 7 years have passed, as required by HM Revenue
and Customs for taxation purposes.

### Membership Payment Data
We do not store or process any of our members’ payment card information, with Membership Payments instead being made via
Standing Order.

Membership Payments and Transactions are stored indefinitely for accounting purposes, but may be decoupled and/or
anonymised after 7 years from the date of payment/transaction, upon request.

Details of payments that are less than the membership threshold are stored, even if hackspace membership is not granted.

We may contact you regarding the amount or frequency of membership payments to the space.

### Payment Data for Tools and/or Snacks
At the Hackspace, we allow members to purchase snacks and to rent out specific tools, as needed.

The data for these transactions are held indefinitely to enable the purchase of snacks the use of tools, and for the
purposes of accounting. This is required to be retained for at least 7 years, for tax purposes, but may be anonymised
past this point, upon request.

### Wiki Data
The hackspace provides a Wiki which is publicly available at all times. Members can use the Wiki in order to share
information relating to the hackspace or its projects.

Contributions to the Wiki are made at a member’s own risk, and are retained indefinitely for preservation and monitoring
purposes. An individual’s contributions can be anonymised and/or decoupled from their account, upon request.
