The Hackspace is maintained by its members. We do not have cleaners, we do not have staff to put tools away at the end
of each day.
Members are responsible for tidying up after themselves. You should make an effort to throw your rubbish in the bin,
clean up your mugs; plates; and other crockery, put away equipment in it's designated place after using it, cleaning up
equipment once you've used it, and in general try to keep the space clean.
Repeatedly failing to clean up after yourself can lead to a warning.

Members should also try to make an effort to tidy up if you notice any mess. If no one tidies up then mess will just not
get cleaned.

Members cannot just leave their projects and possessions at the space. Please see
[6 - storage]({{< ref "/storage.md" >}}) for rules of storing possessions and projects at the space.
